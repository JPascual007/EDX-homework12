## Description:
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this project I architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation Instructions: 
```
1. Download this repository and manipulate the seeds.sql file in order to fit your needs
2. npm install the following dependencies
  - inquirer
  - mysql2
  - express
  - console.table
3. Once all dependencies have been downloaded, start the application by typing "node index.js" into the terminal
```
## MySQL Commands
```
1. mysql -u root -p (log into your mysql account)
2. source db/schema.sql (create database)
3. source db/seeds.sql (seed the database, the seeding are default, make sure to manipulate the seedings to fit into your employee management information)
4. exit (exit mysql and go back to main terminal)
5. node index.js (start the terminal application)
```
